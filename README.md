Professional parts figures, generally displayed in literatures, is the basis for visualizing various functional elements in protein or nucleotide sequences. However, how to draw it has become a big headache to most researchers. 
Usually, Professional parts figures are drawn by mapping software such as photoshop. However, it’s difficult to precisely determine the position and the size of the bio-parts. What’s worse, if there’s anything wrong with the bio-part in between, the domino effect will be extended to its downstream ones, which is quite annoying.
In order to address the problem, we designed a software based on PyCharm as an extensive part of our project, in which users would be provided with multiple choices to help simplify and customize the process of drawing. 
# Our goal is to create professional parts figures within minutes.
